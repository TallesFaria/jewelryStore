Its quite simple actually if you know it. 

First: 
you need to load your frontend from your server:

so add this route to your file:

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
        res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../index.html'))
    });


second you must be aware of what is going on on webpack.config:

entry + output

your index.js (which runs the server) must be on the root directory

you can especify some info in procfile and app.json:

procfile shows which command heroku must run to start the server:

web: npm run start

app.json especifies somethings which helps heroku to identify your code:

{
    "name": "Lucas loja",
    "description": "Storing client's data", 
    "keywords": ["node", "express", "static"],
    "image": "heroku/nodejs"
}

Pay attention to which dependencies are being left out...
